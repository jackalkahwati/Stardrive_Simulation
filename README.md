# Star Drive Relay Simulation System

## Overview
The Star Drive Relay Simulation System is an advanced software suite designed for the simulation and optimization of spacecraft propulsion technologies. It leverages cutting-edge computational methods including genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization to enhance the performance and efficiency of spacecraft maneuvers.

## Features
- **Dynamic Simulation**: Model the physical dynamics of spacecraft propulsion under varying conditions.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Utilize multiple optimization techniques to find optimal solutions for propulsion parameters.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A user-friendly interface for setting parameters, initiating simulations, and viewing results graphically.
- **Detailed Analytics**: Generate comprehensive reports on propulsion efficiency, power requirements, and thermal management.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed, along with the following packages:
- NumPy
